<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    • Tells Browser that this is a HTML File.
    • Tells browser to switch to default mode.
    • The first line in your HTML code should be the doctype declaration.
      A doctype tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in.
    • If you forget to include this line of code in your file,
      then some of the HTML 5 tags like <article>,
      <footer>, and <header> may not be supported by the browser.
-->

<html lang="en">
<!--
    • The <html> tag is the top level element of the HTML file.
      You will nest the<head> and <body> tags inside of it.
    • The lang attribute inside the opening <html> tag sets the language for the page.
      It is also good to include it for accessibility reasons,
    because screen readers will know how to properly pronounce the text.
-->

<head>
    <!--
    • The <head> tags contain information that is processed by machines.
      Inside the <head> tags, you will nest metadata which is data that describes the document to the machine.\
    -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--
    • meta - Enpty Element • charset - character encodeing, tells browser.
    • UTF-8 is the standard character encoding you should use in your web pages.\
      This will usually be the first <meta> tag shown in the <head> element.
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--
    • viewport meta tag: This tag renders the width of the page to the width of the device's screen size.
      If you have a mobile device that is 600px wide, then the browser window will also be 600px wide.
    • The initial-scale controls the zoom level.
      The value of 1 for the initial-scale prevents the default zoom by browsers.
    -->
